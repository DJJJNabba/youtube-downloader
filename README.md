```

## Development

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Production Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Set up a reverse proxy (nginx recommended) for SSL termination and rate limiting.

4. Configure Redis for persistence and security.

5. Set up monitoring and logging.

- `REDIS_PORT` - Redis server port (default: 6379)
- `CLEANUP_TOKEN` - Token for manual cleanup API (change in production)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)

### Rate Limiting

Default rate limits:
- 5 download requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Automatic cleanup of rate limit data

### File Cleanup

- Files expire after 30 minutes
- Automatic cleanup runs every 5 minutes
- Manual cleanup available via API endpoint

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **yt-dlp not found**: Ensure yt-dlp is installed and in PATH
2. **Redis connection failed**: Check Redis server is running and accessible
3. **FFmpeg error**: Install FFmpeg for audio extraction functionality
4. **Download stuck**: Check yt-dlp version and YouTube availability
